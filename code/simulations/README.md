For full reproducibility, we provide here all code for doing the simulations (note that via the links below the notebooks are rendered through [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/):
 - [notebook I](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chrishah/trippart/blob/master/code/simulations/simu.ipynb): shows how the AREG data were downloaded from the AFS and how the simulations were performed.
 - [notebook II](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chrishah/trippart/blob/master/code/simulations/extract_data.ipynb): simulation results are converted into plain text format to be processed in R.
