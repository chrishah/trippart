For full reproducibility, we provide here all code for doing the simulations:
 - [notebook I](https://github/chrishah/trippart/blob/master/code/simulations/simu.ipynb): shows how the AREG data were downloaded from the AFS and how the simulations were performed.
 - [notebook II](https://github.com/chrishah/trippart/blob/master/code/simulations/extract_data.ipynb): simulation results are converted into plain text format to be processed in R.
